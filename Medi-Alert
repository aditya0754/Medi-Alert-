The Medi Alert project is a healthcare-focused system developed to ensure timely medication intake, especially for elderly and busy individuals. It is built using an Arduino microcontroller integrated with an RTC (Real Time Clock) module to accurately track and schedule medicine timings. At the scheduled time, the system provides clear alerts through a P10 LED display and a buzzer, reminding the user to take their medicine. To enhance reliability, a GSM SIM900A module is included, which automatically sends SMS notifications to patients or their caregivers, ensuring no dose is missed even if the user is away from the device. Additionally, an SD card module is used to store medicine schedules and logs for record-keeping. By combining hardware and software, this project not only improves medication adherence but also contributes to better healthcare management and patient safety.
